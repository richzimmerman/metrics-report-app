# metrics-report-app

This is an excel-style MEAN app used to report metrics across a network, separated by region and broken down by site.

The app itself runs on NodeJS with MongoDB, the files are all included but for the sake of the portfolio/demo, I'm just posting the
static page to convey the functionality of the app.
